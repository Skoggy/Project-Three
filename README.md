  ## Installation Instructions
  Run npm install in both the client and server folders, and then from there it can be started up. A connection to an MySQL database is required and the settings can be updated in the config.js file in the server to facilitate the connection. Once that is successful an admin needs to be generated using the register page, and from there the stocklist can be updated and configured to what is needed. Alternatively, one can go to the deployed site and use that as well, where all is needed is for an admin to be created and to go from there.  

  ## Usage Information
  An admin account needs to be created and then with that all of the stock providers and stocks can be created and updated. Then the workers on the floor can select what is being taken and how much and the admin can then keep an eye on the stock levels and generate order forms right from the dashboard as well.
